<h1>HR Analytics Research Project<h1>

This project focuses on exploring the field of HR analytics and understanding how data analysis techniques can be applied to HR data for valuable insights. We utilize Python, particularly leveraging Jupyter Lab with pandas and NumPy libraries for data analysis.

Overview
Human Resources (HR) analytics is the process of collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data regarding human capital to improve workforce performance and drive organizational growth. This project aims to delve into various aspects of HR analytics, including:

Data collection and preprocessing
Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
Predictive modeling
Visualization of HR metrics
Key Features
Data Analysis: We employ Python for data analysis tasks, leveraging the powerful pandas library for data manipulation and NumPy for numerical computing.
Jupyter Lab Integration: Our project is structured around Jupyter Lab, providing an interactive environment for conducting data analysis, visualizations, and documentation.
Exploratory Data Analysis: Through EDA techniques, we uncover patterns, relationships, and trends within HR datasets, enabling informed decision-making.
Predictive Modeling: Utilizing machine learning algorithms, we build predictive models to forecast employee attrition, performance, and other key HR metrics.
Visualizations: We use matplotlib and seaborn libraries to create visual representations of HR data, facilitating easy interpretation and communication of insights.
